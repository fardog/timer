Timer
=====

*Timer* is a small HTML5 application that allows you to create multiple 
countdown timers. Good for timing your tea and hard boiled eggs simultaneously.

To Do
-----

There are a number of features I'd like to add to *Timer* when I get around to it:

- Ability to set timers via GET variables
- Optional resume timers after closing a window
- Time elapsed since a timer finished
- Start/Pause
- Optional ability to name a timer
- Optional silent timer
- HTML5 notifications for finished timers

Much past that feels at odds with the simplicity that I'd intended, so at that point it'll probably be "done".
